If the deceased was a cleric or an official of the Roman Curia, dying outside of Rome (ex curiam) might indicate that the individual was away from their official post or duties. This could raise questions about whether they were on an authorized mission, in exile, or absent for personal reasons."],"la":null},"changeNote":null,"editorialNote":null,"historyNote":null,"scopeNote":null,"notation":null,"example":{"en":null,"la":null},"narrower":[],"narrowerTransitive":[],"broader":{"id":"https://g17.dhi-roma.it/resources/type_92","prefLabel":{"en":"deceased at place","la":null}},"broaderTransitive":null,"related":[],"relatedMatch":null,"broadMatch":null,"narrowMatch":null,"closeMatch":null,"exactMatch":null,"inScheme":[{"id":"https://g17.dhi-roma.it/resources/","title":null}],"inSchemeAll":[{"id":"https://g17.dhi-roma.it/resources/"}],"topConceptOf":[],"deprecated":null,"isReplacedBy":null},"collections":[],"customDomain":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","4240049689","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
